Run Model.py to run the Classification model. 

The documentation is in the Model.py file in the form of comments.

*Please use IDLE or another IDE such as VS-Code*

While the Python script is running, press q to kill it and close the model.

If the python script does not work install the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt

You can do so by opening a command promt with the location of this folder and entering the command ' pip install -r requirements.txt ' 

You may also have to install other dependencies to run the libraries.

The Model.ipynb file is a Jupyter notebook that was used to construct the model.

The Model.h5 file is the AI model which was constructed by the Model.ipynb file and saved.

The database has not been added due to file size limitations.

The files need to be in the same directory to work.

You need to follow the circuit diagram attached in the form of a .pdf file to make connections to the arduino.

Once you've made the connections of the arduino and connected it to your PC as well as installed the libraries, you need to open the Arduino IDE.

Once, you've opened the IDE. You need to click on the files button and then the examples button. Once the examples sub-menu opens, scroll down until you see the firmata examples button. Click on it and then select "StandardFirmata".

After opening the example, upload the example StandardFirmata sketch to Arduino. This initializes the Arduino for input through Python.

If you run it and the led doesn't light-up or there is a error say the port "COM3" does not exist then you need to edit the model.py file with the name of the usb port used by the arduino.

You can test if the Pyfirmata library is working by running the ard.py file.

Otherwise, you can run the non-arduino file.

The model was built with the help of the follwing libraries:

1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
3. Imutils
4. Numpy
5. Opencv
6. Matplotlib
7. Scipy
8. Pyfirmata
9. Pyserial
